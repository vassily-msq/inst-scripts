Curtesy @railsgirls


If the versions match, everything is installed correctly. If the versions
don't match or errors are shown, something went wrong with the automated process
and we will help you do the installation the manual way at the event.

Congrats!

Make sure that all works well by running the application generator command:
    $ rails new railsgirls

If you encounter the message:
    The program 'rails' is currently not installed.

It is just a hiccup with the shell, solutions:                                   
    $ source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
    Allow login shell, example http://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/
